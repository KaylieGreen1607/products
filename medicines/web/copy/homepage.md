The MHRA products website allows you to find:

- The leaflets which are provided with medicines
- The description of the medicinal product’s properties and how it can be used
- Scientific reports about new marketing authorisations for medicines

You can look for any word, phrase or PL number using the search tool.

You can also use the A-Z list to find the active substance.

## SPC-PILs

Every medicine pack includes a patient information leaflet (PIL), which provides information on using the medicine safely.

PILs are based on the Summaries of Product Characteristics (SPCs) which are a description of a medicinal product’s properties and the conditions attached to its use.

The information about a medicine will be updated when new evidence become available. This may mean that there are differences between the information in the pack and the information here.  The most up-to-date information will be available on this site.

You can use the A-Z list to find an active substance, or search for a medicine.

## PARs

We publish scientific assessment reports called a Public Assessment Report (PAR) available for new marketing authorisations granted after 30 October 2005.

This is based on the MHRA assessment report with any commercially or personally confidential information removed.

Use the search function to find a PAR.
